# Political profiling in environmental search 
In this project, we want to **explore** the **differences in search results** for environmental queries between **Bing** users who are politically 'right' and those 
who are politically 'left'. **Selenium** is used to automate the browsing activity of the created profiles, the code can be found in the files create_profiles.py 
and testing_profiles.py. The code for exploring the collected browsing data can be found in the files exploring_environmentaldata.py and exploring_results.py. 
You can find a more detailed explanation of the project in the project paper and presentation.

This project was done for the **Information Retrieval** exam of the MSc in Data Science at Radboud University Nijmegen.
